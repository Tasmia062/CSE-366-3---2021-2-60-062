**Objective :** The goal of this assignment is to develop and implement a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the assignment of multiple robots to set of tasks in a dynamic production environment. Primary objectives are to minimize the total production time, ensure a balanced workload across robots, and prioritize critical tasks effectively. 
**Overview of the Code :** The given code carries out a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to maximize robot work assignment. A population of task assignments is randomly initialized, and then the population is iteratively evolved using tournament selection, crossover, and mutation. The population's fitness is determined based on the balance between production_time and workload. These processes are encapsulated in the "GeneticAlgorithm" class, and the task assignments are visualized on a grid by the "visualize_assignments_improved" function. The GA seeks to reduce workload balance as well as production_time. The code does the GA, creates test data for tasks, priorities, and robot efficiency, and displays the optimal outcome.
